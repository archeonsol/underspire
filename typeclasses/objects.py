    This is the root Object typeclass, representing all entities that
    have an actual presence in-game. DefaultObjects generally have a
    location. They can also be manipulated and looked at. Game
    entities you define should inherit from DefaultObject at some distance.

    It is recommended to create children of this class using the
    `evennia.create_object()` function rather than to initialize the class
    directly - this will both set things up and efficiently save the object
    without `obj.save()` having to be called explicitly.

    Note: Check the autodocs for complete class members, this may not always
    be up-to date.

    * Base properties defined/available on all Objects

     key (string) - name of object
     name (string)- same as key
     dbref (int, read-only) - unique #id-number. Also "id" can be used.
     date_created (string) - time stamp of object creation

     account (Account) - controlling account (if any, only set together with
                       sessid below)
     sessid (int, read-only) - session id (if any, only set together with
                       account above). Use `sessions` handler to get the
                       Sessions directly.
     location (Object) - current location. Is None if this is a room
     home (Object) - safety start-location
     has_account (bool, read-only)- will only return *connected* accounts
     contents (list, read only) - returns all objects inside this object
     exits (list of Objects, read-only) - returns all exits from this
                       object, if any
     destination (Object) - only set if this object is an exit.
     is_superuser (bool, read-only) - True/False if this user is a superuser
     is_connected (bool, read-only) - True if this object is associated with
                            an Account with any connected sessions.
     has_account (bool, read-only) - True is this object has an associated account.
     is_superuser (bool, read-only): True if this object has an account and that
                        account is a superuser.

    * Handlers available

     aliases - alias-handler: use aliases.add/remove/get() to use.
     permissions - permission-handler: use permissions.add/remove() to
                   add/remove new perms.
     locks - lock-handler: use locks.add() to add new lock strings
     scripts - script-handler. Add new scripts to object with scripts.add()
     cmdset - cmdset-handler. Use cmdset.add() to add new cmdsets to object
     nicks - nick-handler. New nicks with nicks.add().
     sessions - sessions-handler. Get Sessions connected to this
                object with sessions.get()
     attributes - attribute-handler. Use attributes.add/remove/get.
     db - attribute-handler: Shortcut for attribute-handler. Store/retrieve
            database attributes using self.db.myattr=val, val=self.db.myattr
     ndb - non-persistent attribute handler: same as db but does not create
            a database entry when storing data

    * Hooks (these are class methods, so args should start with self):

     basetype_setup()     - only called once, used for behind-the-scenes
                            setup. Normally not modified.
     basetype_posthook_setup() - customization in basetype, after the object
                            has been created; Normally not modified.

     at_object_creation() - only called once, when object is first created.
                            Object customizations go here.
     at_object_delete() - called just before deleting an object. If returning
                            False, deletion is aborted. Note that all objects
                            inside a deleted object are automatically moved
                            to their <home>, they don't need to be removed here.

     at_init()            - called whenever typeclass is cached from memory,
                            at least once every server restart/reload
     at_first_save()
     at_cmdset_get(**kwargs) - this is called just before the command handler
                            requests a cmdset from this object. The kwargs are
                            not normally used unless the cmdset is created
                            dynamically (see e.g. Exits).
     at_pre_puppet(account)- (account-controlled objects only) called just

                            before un-puppeting
     at_post_unpuppet(account) - (account-controlled objects only) called just
                            after disconnecting account<->object link
     at_server_reload()   - called before server is reloaded
     at_server_shutdown() - called just before server is fully shut down

     at_access(result, accessing_obj, access_type) - called with the result
                            of a lock access check on this object. Return value

     at_pre_move(destination)             - called just before moving object
                        to the destination. If returns False, move is cancelled.
     announce_move_from(destination)         - called in old location, just
                        before move, if obj.move_to() has quiet=False
     announce_move_to(source_location)       - called in new location, just
                        after move, if obj.move_to() has quiet=False
     at_post_move(source_location)          - always called after a move has
